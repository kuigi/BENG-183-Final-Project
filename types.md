# Types of Molecular Clock Models 

In our implementation of the molecular clock model onto the phylogenic tree that we choose, we have to select the type of molecular clock model that best fits our data. We make this decision by fitting each clock model in BEAST and seeing which model fits our data best. 
The types of molecular clock models differ simply in how they handle evolutionary rate variation. We want a clock that fits our data and doesn't over or underfit by selecting a model that displays as much rate variation as we'd expect for the type of taxa, virus, or sequence in general that we're looking at. 

## Strict Clocks

Strict clocks are the most basic form of molecular clocks, assu

## Relaxed Clocks

## Local Clocks

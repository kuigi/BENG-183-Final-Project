# Types of Molecular Clock Models 
The primary objective of molecular clock analysis is to look at how over time, genetic sequences accumulate substitutions according to some statistical process. From these substitutions or sequences changes, we can place a clock model with a statistical model that best fits the sequence's evolution. From this, we can estimate things like evolutionary rates and divergence times. 
In our implementation of the molecular clock model onto the phylogenic tree that we choose, we have to select the type of molecular clock model that best fits our data. We make this decision by identifying the model that provides the best balance between model complexity and goodness of fit, especially regarding the biological features of the data.

## Strict Clocks

A strict molecular clock, also called a global clock, assumes that the phylogenetic tree maintains the same rate of substutions per unit time throughout all branches.

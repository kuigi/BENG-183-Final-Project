5\. Historical Significance

5.1  Neutral Evolutionary Theory

"This neutral theory claims that the overwhelming majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level are not caused by selection acting on advantageous mutants, but by random fixation of selectively neutral or very nearly neutral mutants through the cumulative effect of sampling drift (due to finite population number) under continued input of new mutations" (Kimura, 1991\)

[Neutral Evolutionary Theory](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/neutral-theory-the-null-hypothesis-of-molecular-839/) was developed by the Japanese scientist Motoo Kimura in 1968, proposing that most variation at the molecular level is not a result of natural selection and does not affect fitness, and so the majority of genetic variation is explained via randomness.

Pseudogenes and nonfunctional areas of the genomes mutate at a far faster rate than active genes, and synonymous mutations occur at a much higher rate than non-synonymous ones. Actively beneficial mutations are rare, meaning the remaining mutations do not have strong effects on the population. The majority of mutations found in the genome are evolutionarily neutral. Kimura’s model shows that the rate of neutral mutations is a consequence of the mutation rate, not selection. His calculated mutation rate gave credibility to the concept of the molecular evolutionary clock, revolutionizing genetic research, as by calculating the mutation rate and number of mutations present, the genetic age of a species can be estimated.

5.2 COVID-19 Sequencing

During COVID-19, BEAST (as well as other bioinformatics tools MEGA-X and TempEst) was used to track the introduction and movement of SARS-CoV-2. 

Using these tools, scientists built the virus’s genomic evolutionary tree, deduced how it changed over time, found its Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor, or TMRCA, and analyzed the virus’s selection pressures ([Analysis of variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7086142/))

They also found the spread path of the virus—originating in China before spreading to other Asian countries before moving to the Americas and Europe. ([Evaluation of global evolutionary variations in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8511646/))

This research helped identify COVID-19’s global variant patterns and potential evolutionary directions, which supported the development of vaccines and other preventative measures like predictive outbreak models.

6\. Limitations of the Molecular Evolutionary Clock

6.0 Introduction

Molecular clocks are powerful tools, but they have several important limitations. [Inconsistent mutation rates, lack of fossil record, natural selection](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/evolution-population-dynmaics/a/evolutionary-time#:~:text=Limitations%20and%20Challenges&text=Selection%20and%20Adaptive%20Evolution%3A%20While,molecular%20clock%20in%20certain%20cases), and [substitutional saturation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9016599/) can all introduce uncertainties into the final results.

6.1  Inconsistent Mutation Rates

Mutation rates are not constant. Although molecular clocks often assume a steady rate of mutation, real biological systems show substantial variation. Mutation rates differ across species due to factors such as generation time, DNA repair efficiency, and environmental pressures. Even within a single organism, different genes evolve at different rates. While careful gene selection can reduce some of this variability, it remains an important limitation of molecular clock models.

6.2 Difficult Calibration

Fossil calibration is inherently uncertain. Molecular clock estimates often rely on fossils to anchor divergence times. However, the fossil record is incomplete and sometimes difficult to interpret, which introduces uncertainty into calibration points. Missing or ambiguous fossils can therefore cascade error down the whole timescale.

6.3 Effect of Selection

Selection affects apparent mutation rates. Molecular clocks work best when most mutations are neutral and accumulate at a roughly consistent pace. However, natural selection disrupts this process. Purifying (negative) selection removes deleterious mutations, making evolutionary rates appear slower, while positive selection accelerates the fixation of advantageous mutations. These selective pressures can distort rate estimates and complicate clock-based inferences.

6.4 Substitutional Saturation

Multiple substitutions at the same nucleotide site obscure true evolutionary change. A single site in a sequence may mutate more than once over long time periods. Additionally, depending on how densely sequences are sampled through time, some mutations may go undetected. This phenomenon—often called substitutional saturation—causes observed genetic differences to underestimate the actual number of mutations, reducing the accuracy of molecular clock estimates.
